h1. Jekyll

By Tom Preston-Werner, Nick Quaranto, and many awesome contributors!

Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind "GitHub Pages":http://pages.github.com, which you can use to host your project's page or blog right here from GitHub.

h1. Extension Overview

This extension introduces a Table of Contents which can easily be added to a post. This feature only works with textile currently (as the ToC is generated to textile).

h1. Usage

The ToC works by reading the headers on a post and saving them with hierarchy.

Example:

@h1. Introduction@
@h2. Overview@
@h2. Technical Details@
@h3. Login System@
@h1. Development@
@h2. Duration@
@h1. Conclusion@

Gets transformed into the following hierarchy:

* Introduction
** Overview
** Technical Detail
*** Login System
* Development
** Duration
* Conclusion

*WARNING* So this hierarchy can work the titles must start with the lowest index which shall be used (e.g. if @h3.@ is used, @h1.@Â or @h2.@ cannot be used within that post).

h2. Adding ToC to a post

To add this feature to a post you will just need to add the following token to the desired post, at the correct position of the article:

@<!-- TOC -->@

h2. Customizing ToC Appearance

To see how to customize the appearance let's look at the following example:

```html
<div class="standard_div"><div class="toc">
<p id="toc_title">Article contents</p>
<ul>
	<li class="depth_1"><a href="#Defining_a_Recursive_Function" class="toc_link">Defining a Recursive Function</a>
	<ul>
		<li class="depth_2"><a href="#Identifying_the_extreme_cases" class="toc_link">Identifying the extreme cases</a></li>
		<li class="depth_2"><a href="#Identifying_general_cases" class="toc_link">Identifying general cases</a></li>
		<li class="depth_2"><a href="#Merging_it_all" class="toc_link">Merging it all</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li class="depth_1"><a href="#Converting_Recursive_Function_to_Iterative" class="toc_link">Converting Recursive Function to Iterative</a>
	<ul>
		<li class="depth_2"><a href="#Back_to_Fibonacci" class="toc_link">Back to Fibonacci</a></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
```

To customize the ToC, you can use the following CSS rules:

.toc {}
.toc_link {}
#toc_title {}
.depth_1 {}
.depth_2 {}
.depth_3 {}
.depth_4 {}
.depth_5 {}
